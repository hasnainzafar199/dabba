		<p style="font-size:17pt">&nbsp &nbsp Dabba is the oldest established South Asian restaurant in your region, located in the heart of Brooklyn, New York. 
		Since 1992 restaurant owner Chef Zafar has shared his passion for cooking, bringing his guests tantillizing dishes prepared
		with the freshest ingredients and most aromatic spices imported from South Asian countries.</br></br>
		
		 &nbsp &nbsp In fact, Dabba has become an “institution” with the locals.
		Whether you are dining in house with us, enjoying take-out or having our establishment cater your special event, 
		you will experience a taste of the cultures of the South Asian region. Located in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

		 Customers flock to the Dabba for their scrumptious Naan bread and Tandoor specialties, as well as their Curries. 
		 Drawing upon treasured family recipes, Chef Zafar’s food is more than just a feast for the senses. He performs his cooking as an art form and infuses his dishes with 
		 love and devotion.</br></br>

		&nbsp &nbsp In the tradition of Pakistan & Indian cooking, we believe that food is a celebration of life. It nourishes not only our bodies but our spirit.
		Our family looks forward to sharing our culinary traditions with you. Come celebrate!
